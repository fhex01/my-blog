**Welcome to this 2025 overview of `BloodHound Community Edition (CE)`, the go-to tool for mapping Active Directory relationships like a pro.** *Whether you're part of a red team, a blue team, or just curious about how privilege escalation paths work,* this article breaks down what's new, what's improved, and why `BloodHound CE` still matters in 2025. We'll walk through recent updates, practical use cases, and a few tips on getting the most out of the tool, all while keeping it **simple**, *sharp*, and a bit `hands-on`.

**First of all**, it's important to know that there are multiple versions of `BloodHound`, in fact, there are _three_. There's `Legacy`, `Community Edition` _(which this article focuses on)_, and `Enterprise`.

Regarding the [Legacy version](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound-Legacy), the main difference with the CE is its age. `BloodHound Legacy` is used in versions â‰¤ `3.x`, so it's quite old. It has:

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) interface (desktop app), based on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
- Uses [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) exclusively.
- Fewer updates / less maintenance since _2023_.
- Basic `Cypher` features but no recent additions.
- Doesn't benefit from performance, security, or UI improvements.

It has an outdated UI, harder-to-maintain dependencies, and is less suited to modern environments. 

Regarding the [Community Edition](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound), `BloodHound CE` is the modern, actively maintained open-source version. It's designed for both offensive and defensive teams and includes:

- A web-based interface built with [React](https://react.dev/).
- Containerized backend with a [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) API.
- Supports both [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html).
- Built-in [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview), [SAML](https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/) support, and [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-two-factor-authentication-2fa).
- Protected `Cypher` queries to ensure performance stability.
- Compatibility with both [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) and [Azure environments](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/deployment-environments).

It's a powerful, flexible tool, ideal for professionals who want advanced graph analysis without a commercial license.

And then, regarding the [Enterprise version](https://specterops.io/bloodhound-overview/?utm_campaign=PAID_Paid_Google_250115_PaidSearch&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=gog&Latest_Campaign=701Uw00000KaFjP&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21232553513&gbraid=0AAAAA9ad7ZeVGwwYwjzoiop_FRkc46hjl&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgIXCBhDBARIsAELC9ZjjdqzkEN9YtRMlaxPdIQtZlKQpCiABUrNrPiZpSD5mgTg4V2HvWgwaAhe1EALw_wcB), `BloodHound Enterprise` is the commercial, fully managed solution focused on continuous Attack Path Management. It offers:

- Real-time mapping of identity attack paths.
- Identification and prioritization of [Tier Zero](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/coreinfrastructureandsecurityblog/protecting-tier-0-the-modern-way/4052851) assets.
- Chokepoint detection and guided remediation paths.
- Advanced risk trend analysis and reporting.
- Integration with tools like [On Demand Audit](https://appsource.microsoft.com/fr-fr/product/web-apps/quest.oda-hs?tab=Overview).

It's designed for organizations that need a robust, proactive security posture across complex environments.

In summary, whether you're using `BloodHound Legacy`, exploring the modern capabilities of `Community Edition`, or investing in the full power of `Enterprise`, each version serves a distinct purpose. `Legacy` may still work for older setups, but `CE` is the go-to for up-to-date, open-source graph analysis, while `Enterprise` provides a comprehensive, real-time solution for organizations serious about attack path management. Choosing the right version depends on your goals, environment, and how deep you want to go into identity security.
